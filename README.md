# CoBRA Task V2
Competitive Behavioral assessment of Rivalry and Admiration (CoBRA) task – version 2

## Short description
The CoBRA task is a social decision-making task designed to behaviorally capture narcissistic reactions to defeat, namely narcissistic rivalry and admiration-seeking, in a computer game competition where the outcomes are rigged. Players are told they will play against previous participants whose performance has been recorded and that they will take part in the competition’s global ranking.

For a detailed description of the task, see the following article and its supplement (for any questions regarding the task, please contact the corresponding author, Anna Szücs):

➔ Szücs A, Wright AG, Edershile EA, Dombrovski AY, Rivalry and admiration-seeking in a social competition: from traits to behaviors through contextual cues. Accepted by Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment.

Competitive behaviors are measured by 2 distinct outcome measures:

• outcome measure 1 – apple/point stealing – behavioral rivalry: on each trial, before competing, participants can choose to steal points from their assigned opponent’s score on that trial.

• outcome measure 2 – rank buying – behavioral admiration-seeking: at the end of each round, participants can pay for a booster that improves their rank in the competition’s global ranking.

In this second version (V2.6), the task’s design allows to play up to four blocks of 36 trial each with different defeat:victory ratios, which define extreme losing (3 defeats to 1 victory), moderate losing (2 defeats to 1 victory), winning (1 defeat to 2 victories) or neutral (1 defeat to 1 victory) conditions. You can choose to play only some of these blocks, or all of them.

## Software requirements:
Please, note that this game is designed to work on Windows computers and tablets, the code may need adaptations to run on Mac OS or GNU Linux. You need to have MATLAB (version 2013 or older) installed, as well as Python 2.7 installed under C:\python27 (default installation folder).

## Installation:
[1]	Download the content of this repository (e.g., as a zip file, top right option) and decompress the resulting .zip file *cobra_task_v2-6-main.zip* in a location of your choice.
Warning: Do not put its content into MATLAB’s folder; anywhere else is fine.

[2]	Open the resulting *cobra_task_v1-main* folder (created when decompressing the zip file).

[3]	Carefully read the user manual *cobra_task_v1_manual.pdf* before launching the task.

[4]	To run the task, open the file *main_game_launcher.m* with MATLAB (right click -> Open with -> MATLAB), and simply click “run” from the MATLAB editor window (green arrowhead in the upper menu). If prompted by MATLAB, select the "Change Folder" option.

Further instructions, troubleshooting tips, and a codebook to measured variables can be found in the **user manual**.
